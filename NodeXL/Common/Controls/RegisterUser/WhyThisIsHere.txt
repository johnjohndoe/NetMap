
This is a user control that registers a user of the ExcelTemplate project.  It
gets used in two places:

1. In the RegisterUserDialog within ExcelTemplate.  The dialog is opened by
   the user via an Excel ribbon button.

2. In the ExcelTemplateRegisterUser Windows Forms application.  This
   application gets called from the ExcelTemplateSetup executable when the user
   opts to register during setup.

Given that the control is used in two places, the most efficient and consistent
location for it would be within the ApplicationUtil class library assembly,
which could then be referenced by both ExcelTemplate and
ExcelTemplateRegisterUser.  This works fine for ExcelTemplate but not for
ExcelTemplateRegisterUser.

During setup, the executable specified within the Visual Studio-supplied
"Register User" dialog gets executed within a temporary folder in the user's
profile, not within the application folder.  Because of this, the executable
can't reference any assemblies not present in that temporary folder or
pre-installed in the GAC.  This rules out having ExcelTemplateRegisterUser
reference the ApplicationUtil assembly, which exists only in the application
folder.

For this reason, the user control is put in a common directory and linked to
the two projects via the Add as Link option in Visual Studio's Add Existing
Item dialog.  The user control code is thus duplicated in two executables, but
at least it works.
