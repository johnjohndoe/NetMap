
NodeXL's layout scheme is extensible.  To add a layout that implements a new
layout algorithm, follow these steps:

1. Create a class that implements IAsyncLayout.  The easiest way to do this is
   to derive the new class from AsyncLayoutBase.

2. Add it to the Layouts project.

3. Search for the LayoutType enumeration, which is in a different NodeXL
   project, and read the comments at the end of the enumeration.
